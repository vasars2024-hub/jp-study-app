# L9 — Shell, widgets, and alternate identities

## 2026-08-30 — Taskbar presentation entry point

L9 opened from the measured L8 close at `02d46d61`. The first product gap was an
asymmetric entry point: a presentable window could switch Standard/Liquid only from its
title bar, while right-clicking the same taskbar entry offered lifecycle commands but no
presentation command.

The taskbar menu now uses the same `canPresentLiquid`, `isWinLiquid`, and
`toggleWinPresentation` path as the title bar. It adds exactly one reversible item:
`Make Liquid` in Standard and the catalog's `Return to standard window` in Liquid. The
existing EN/JA/ZH/RU keys are reused. Note, City, and Visualizer remain excluded by the
shared predicate; no window is forced into Liquid and the default remains Standard.

Live on Resources, populated with 51 cards: menu rows were 5 before and 5 after; Standard
→ Liquid changed only the `fwin-liquid` class. The reverse restored the exact captured
snapshot: style `left 162 / top 114 / 820x580 / z 173`, query empty, All selected, 51
cards, scroll 0, focus true. Focused tests: 40/40 across the new menu guard and the existing
presentation round-trip/presentability suite.

L9's first bullet remains OPEN: this closes the taskbar presentation route, not the whole
taskbar/context/command entry-point inventory. Next: desktop context-menu and command-palette
language/identity gaps, then score the entry-point group rather than declaring it from source.
