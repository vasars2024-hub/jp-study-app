# Main Study OS v1 evidence ledger

Last updated: 2026-08-08. This ledger is source-derived and intentionally compact. It does not inherit completion claims from older documents.

## Repository and baseline

- Workspace: `C:\Users\Arseniy\Projects\jp-study-app`
- Branch / starting HEAD: `feat/nyaa-subtitles` / `9c74730`
- Starting staged state: empty.
- Starting worktree: 406 changed paths (171 modified, 133 deleted, 102 untracked). All pre-existing paths are treated as user-owned.
- Recent relevant commits: `8d7642a` (SQLite/FTS dictionary), `9c74730` (sense-gloss indexing and real-corpus proof).
- Focused starting baseline: credential + dictionary tests, 136 passed / 6 skipped.
- Full post-slice baseline: 433 files passed / 1 skipped; 5,782 tests passed / 6 skipped.
- TypeScript baseline: red before the slice with project-wide test/module-mode errors and unrelated renderer/scraper errors. Changed-path filtering after the slice shows the same top-level-await test pattern and an existing `src/main/mining.ts:1705` IPC-handler type error; no new production error remains in the credential adapters.
- Architecture gate: 1,518 modules, 18 known findings, nothing new; 3 known test-only findings remain pending.
- i18n gates: catalog parity, locale-argument, missing-key, and hardcoded-text checks all pass with only their recorded baselines.

## Source-derived execution map

| Requirement | Starting status | Evidence / ownership | Next dependency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Encrypted credential vault and Jiten migration | Implemented but uncommitted; focused tests passed | `src/main/credentials/*`, `src/main/jiten.ts`, Settings API-key page and IPC wiring are part of an existing dirty-tree track | Reconcile MAL OAuth tokens and scraper credential references without absorbing unrelated `main.ts` / preload work |
| Gemini / DeepSeek credentials | Broken security policy: separate store could downgrade to plaintext | Clean-at-HEAD `src/main/mining.ts` explicitly wrote plaintext when `safeStorage` was unavailable | Completed in first slice; provider health/client unification remains |
| Jimaku / OpenSubtitles credentials | Broken security policy: separate unmarked store could downgrade to plaintext | Clean-at-HEAD `src/main/subtitleProviderClients.ts` | Completed in first slice; retain provider-specific Test calls backed by shared status metadata |
| Professional Lexicon core | Partially implemented, automated foundation verified | SQLite/FTS service plus Yomitan, CEDICT and Tatoeba code; dictionary focused suite passed. Dictionary and Translate are still separate `AppSection` routes | Audit service adoption/migrations, then build compatibility aliases into one Workbench |
| Central AI Agent | Partially implemented foundation; first-class app genuinely missing | Typed tools, runtime, profiles, memory, knowledge, queue, scheduler and Study handlers exist. `AppSection.tsx` has no Agent route or surface | Define central context/conversation contracts after credential/provider foundation |
| Unified Reading workspace | Partial and collision-prone | Reading Finder and Novels remain separate routed components; both are already modified in the dirty tree | Defer until ownership reconciliation after shared foundations |
| ReadingLens Capture and Read | Partial | Main capture service, overlay, settings and tests exist; source still presents an overlay rather than the complete three-depth workflow | Defer until Lexicon + Reading contracts exist |
| Media shell / Liquid | Implemented in several layers but live release state still needs a dedicated regression audit | Mature Media shell/workspace components exist and many paths are already modified; live Electron session restored but Media was not changed in this slice | Independent post-foundation audit, serialized live verification |
| Remaining v1 surfaces | Unverified | Large dirty-tree overlap and stale documents prevent honest blanket status | Re-derive per route after the dependency tracks above |

## Slice 1 — shared vault adoption for AI and subtitle providers

Starting status: Gemini, DeepSeek, Jimaku and OpenSubtitles used feature-owned files and could write new plaintext secrets when OS encryption was unavailable.

Changed paths owned by this slice:

- `src/main/credentials/ai.ts`
- `src/main/credentials/subtitles.ts`
- `src/main/credentials/ipc.ts`
- `src/main/mining.ts`
- `src/main/subtitleProviderClients.ts`
- `src/shared/credentialRegistry.ts`
- `src/main/__tests__/credentialLegacyAdapters.test.ts`
- credential vault / registry tests already belonging to the uncommitted credential track

Behavior now established:

- New AI and subtitle credentials are written only through `credentials.dat` using the shared refusal policy.
- If OS encryption is unavailable, new writes fail and no plaintext file is created.
- Existing plaintext or encrypted legacy values migrate one provider at a time; the old value is removed only after the vault confirms an encrypted write.
- A legacy plaintext value is retained and remains usable if encryption is unavailable, avoiding silent credential loss without creating a new downgrade.
- Feature-specific clients read the same vault values; renderer status objects contain no secret field.
- Credential IPC validates both the registry id and declared field.
- Subtitle provider tests write their result metadata back to the central status.

Automated evidence:

- Focused post-slice: 5 files / 68 tests passed.
- Full suite: 433 files passed, 1 skipped; 5,782 tests passed, 6 skipped.
- Architecture and all i18n gates: pass with no new findings.
- `eslint` on the credential slice: pass.
- `git diff --check` on the credential slice: pass (line-ending notices only).

Live and visual evidence:

- Electron debug bridge cold-reloaded after restoring the renderer dev server; live route `http://localhost:5173/entry?id=567` mounted successfully.
- Settings -> API keys rendered six providers. Vault status and legacy feature APIs agreed: Gemini configured, DeepSeek absent, Jimaku configured, OpenSubtitles absent, Jiten absent; `canStore: true`.
- Renderer-safe audit contained no serialized secret value. Keyboard focus reached an enabled password input with the correct accessible label.
- Large screenshot: `debug/shots/win1-1786178653549.png` at 1264 x 821; no horizontal overflow in the settings pane and no broken controls.
- Compact screenshot: `debug/shots/win1-1786178676686.png` at 924 x 611. It exposes a pre-existing shell defect: a maximized 1264px Settings layout is clipped by the compact native viewport. This is not caused by credential CSS and remains open.
- In-app Browser/Playwright cannot mount the production renderer independently because Electron preload APIs are required (`playerBus.ts` fails on missing `window.api`). Therefore production Electron DOM/state and screenshots were captured through the permitted application debug bridge; no Computer Use, coordinate CUA, or `tab.cua` was used.

Remaining risk:

- MAL OAuth tokens still live in `mal-tokens.json`; the existing store can persist plaintext and must receive a profile-aware vault migration.
- Scraper credentials share the refusal primitive but remain a separate reference store.
- Provider health, model selection, budgets/costs, caching, cancellation, streaming, retry and privacy are not yet one structured provider service.
- Compact shell clipping is a release-level visual defect outside this slice.

Checkpoint: `feat(credentials): centralize provider secrets in encrypted vault` (the final hash is reported outside this self-contained ledger). Generic Settings IPC/preload wiring remains uncommitted because those shared files contain unrelated user work; the specialized Jiten, AI and subtitle paths in this checkpoint are independently functional.

## Exact next slice

Migrate MAL OAuth access/refresh tokens to the shared vault while preserving profile identity, expiry and username metadata; refuse new plaintext persistence; prove one-way migration, unavailable-encryption retention, disconnect, refresh and renderer-safe status. Then reconcile scraper credential references and begin the shared provider runtime contract.
